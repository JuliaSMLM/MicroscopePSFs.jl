Please generate a comprehensive test suite for this Julia package, focusing on maintainable tests that verify high-level functionality. The tests should be organized following Julia's best practices for package testing.

## Test Structure Requirements

1. Create a well-organized `test/runtests.jl` file following this exact structure:
   ```julia
   using YourPackage
   using Test

   @testset "YourPackage.jl" begin
       # Notify which tests are being run
       println("\nRunning YourPackage tests...\n")
       
       @testset "Core Types" begin
           include("test_core_types.jl")
       end
       
       @testset "Basic Functionality" begin
           include("test_basic_functionality.jl")
       end
       
       @testset "Advanced Features" begin
           include("test_advanced_features.jl")
       end
       
       @testset "Integration" begin
           include("test_integration.jl")
       end
   end
   ```

2. Key requirements:
1. ALL package imports and using statements must go in runtests.jl - do NOT include imports in individual test files
   - A single top-level testset named after the package
   - Nested testsets that include separate test files
   - Clear, descriptive names for each test group
   - No direct test code in runtests.jl - only includes

## Test Coverage Guidelines

1. Prioritize testing high-level interfaces over internal implementation details
2. Focus on maintainability and overall functionality rather than exhaustively testing every edge case
3. Include tests for:
   - Core types and their constructors
   - Main API functions and their common use cases
   - Important workflows that users would follow
   - Known edge cases that could cause issues
   - Regression tests for previously fixed bugs

## Test Files Organization

Please organize individual test files by functionality area, with each file containing:

1. No imports - ALL imports must go in runtests.jl
2. Logically grouped tests for related functionality
3. Meaningful test descriptions that serve as documentation

Example test file structure:
```julia
# test/test_core_types.jl

# No imports here - ALL imports must go in runtests.jl

@testset "Type Construction" begin
    # Test basic construction
    @test TypeName(args...) isa TypeName
    
    # Test field initialization
    instance = TypeName(args...)
    @test instance.field == expected_value
    
    # Test validation behavior
    @test_throws ErrorType TypeName(invalid_args...)
end

@testset "Type Behavior" begin
    # Test core behavior
    instance = TypeName(args...)
    @test some_function(instance) == expected_result
end
```

## Test Generation Priorities

1. Start with basic tests for all exported functions and types
2. Add detailed tests for core functionality
3. Include at least one integration test that combines multiple components
4. Test common user workflows from start to finish
5. Focus on correctness of results rather than implementation details

## Testing Best Practices

1. Make tests deterministic (use fixed random seeds if randomness is involved)
2. Keep tests fast - avoid long-running tests unless necessary
3. Use descriptive failure messages to aid debugging
4. Separate unit tests from integration tests
5. Test both success and failure paths

## Helper Functions

1. Create helper functions for repetitive test setup:
   ```julia
   # Create test data used by multiple tests
   function create_test_data()
       # Initialize test data
       return data
   end
   ```

2. For complex test scenarios, create fixtures:
   ```julia 
   # Set up a complete test environment
   function test_fixture()
       # Setup code
       return (data=data, config=config)
   end
   ```

## Result Format

Please provide:

1. A complete `test/runtests.jl` file following the specified structure
2. Individual test files for each major component of the package
3. A summary of test coverage, including:
   - Which exported functions and types are tested
   - Any deliberately untested parts (with rationale)
   - Suggestions for additional tests that could be added later

Thank you for generating these tests. The focus should be on creating a maintainable test suite that verifies the package works correctly, not on achieving 100% code coverage.
