# Create an API Overview File for This Julia Package

Please generate an API overview document for this Julia package that will serve both human users and AI assistants. Follow the structure and guidelines below.

## Step 1: Create an API Overview File

Create a file named `api_overview.md` in the root directory of your package:

```
YourPackage/
├── src/
├── test/
├── docs/
├── Project.toml
├── README.md
└── api_overview.md  <- Create this file
```

This file should contain a concise, structured overview of your package's API with examples. Organize it with clear markdown headings (use ## for sections).

## Why Create an API Overview?

### For Humans
- Provides a **concise reference** without diving into full documentation
- Offers **quick-start examples** for common use cases
- Shows **relevant patterns** more clearly than individual docstrings
- Creates an **at-a-glance understanding** of package capabilities
- Complements detailed documentation with a **higher-level view**

### For AI Assistants
- Enables **better code generation** with correct API patterns
- Provides **structured context** about type hierarchies and relationships
- Offers **consistent examples** to learn from when generating code
- Creates **clear patterns** to follow when suggesting package usage
- Helps avoid **common pitfalls** or misunderstandings about the API

## What to Include in Your API Overview

### 1. Key Concepts
- Brief explanation of the core concepts and terminology
- Domain-specific information necessary to understand the API
- Important conventions (units, coordinate systems, defaults)

### 2. Type Hierarchy
- Visual representation of main types and their relationships
- Clear indication of abstract vs. concrete types
- Type parameters and their meaning

### 3. Essential Types
- Type definitions for most important types
- Field documentation with types and purpose
- Comments on mutable vs. immutable choices

### 4. Constructor Examples
- Common ways to instantiate key types
- Parameter patterns and naming conventions
- Default values and optional parameters

### 5. Core Functions
- Main functions grouped by purpose
- Input/output patterns
- Common parameter combinations

### 6. Common Workflows
- Step-by-step examples of typical usage patterns
- Multiple approaches to solving common problems
- Integration examples showing how components work together

### 7. Complete Examples
- Full working examples demonstrating end-to-end usage
- Comments explaining each step
- Sample output where appropriate

## Writing Style Best Practices

1. **Be Concise**: Prioritize brevity and clarity over exhaustive coverage
2. **Use Consistent Formatting**: Maintain consistent structure for similar items
3. **Focus on Patterns**: Highlight patterns that can be generalized
4. **Include Type Information**: Make types explicit in examples and descriptions
5. **Comment Liberally**: Include comments in code examples explaining parameter purposes
6. **Use Clear Section Headers**: Make the document easily scannable with descriptive headers
7. **Show Don't Tell**: Prefer concrete examples over abstract descriptions
8. **Include Important Gotchas**: Note common pitfalls or non-obvious behaviors

## Formatting Guidelines

### Markdown Structure
- Use `#` for title
- Use `##` for main sections
- Use `###` for subsections
- Use backticks for inline code
- Use triple backticks for code blocks with language specifier
- Use bold (`**text**`) for important concepts

### Code Examples
- Always specify the language for code blocks: ```julia
- Use descriptive variable names
- Include comments for non-obvious steps
- Show both simple and complex cases
- Align similar elements for readability
- Include complete function calls with all parameters

### Type Definitions
- Include complete type definitions with field comments
- Show type parameters explicitly
- Indicate mutability clearly

## Example Section: "Filtering Operations"

Here's an example of how you might document filtering operations in your package:

When writing your actual Markdown, you would use the following structure:

- A level-2 heading: `## Filtering Operations`
- A Julia code block (with triple backticks and "julia" language specifier)
- Code examples with comments
- A brief explanation text
- A numbered list explaining key points

Your code examples would look like this:

```julia
# Filter by emitter properties using @filter macro
bright = @filter(smld, photons > 1000)
precise = @filter(smld, σ_x < 0.02 && σ_y < 0.02)
combined = @filter(smld, photons > 1000 && σ_x < 0.02)

# Select frames
frame_5 = filter_frames(smld, 5)                 # Single frame
early_frames = filter_frames(smld, 1:10)         # Range of frames
specific_frames = filter_frames(smld, [1,3,5,7]) # Specific frames

# Select region of interest (ROI)
# 2D ROI
roi_2d = filter_roi(smld, 1.0:5.0, 2.0:6.0)      # x_range, y_range

# 3D ROI (for 3D emitters only)
roi_3d = filter_roi(smld, 1.0:5.0, 2.0:6.0, -1.0:1.0)  # x_range, y_range, z_range
```

Then follow with explanatory text like:

"The package provides several approaches to filtering data:

1. The `@filter` macro allows filtering by any emitter property using natural condition syntax
2. `filter_frames` selects emitters from specific frames efficiently
3. `filter_roi` selects emitters within spatial regions of interest"

## Maintenance Tips

1. **Update with API Changes**: Keep the overview in sync with API changes
2. **Focus on Stability**: Emphasize stable, public API features
3. **Revise Examples**: Update examples to reflect current best practices
4. **Solicit Feedback**: Ask users which aspects need more examples
5. **Compare with Usage**: Review real-world usage patterns and reflect them

## How to Test Your Overview

To ensure your API overview is effective:

1. **Ask a New User**: Have someone unfamiliar with your package try using it with just the overview
2. **Test Code Examples**: Verify all code examples run correctly
3. **Check Patterns**: Ensure patterns shown are current best practices
4. **Review for Completeness**: Confirm all essential functionality is represented
5. **Check for AI Usability**: Verify AI assistants can successfully use the overview to generate correct code
